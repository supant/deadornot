She has also frequently reinvented both her music and image while maintaining autonomy within the recording industry. Besides sparking controversy, her works have been praised by [[Music criticism|music critics]]. Madonna is often cited as an influence by [[List of artists influenced by Madonna|other artists]].\n\nBorn and raised in [[Michigan]], Madonna moved to [[New York City]] in 1978 to pursue a career in modern dance. After performing as a drummer, guitarist, and vocalist in the rock bands [[Breakfast Club (band)|Breakfast Club]] and Emmy, Madonna signed with [[Sire Records]] in 1982 and released her [[Madonna (Madonna album)|eponymous debut album]] the next year. She followed it with a series of successful albums, including the [[List of best-selling albums|global bestsellers]] ''[[Like a Virgin (album)|Like a Virgin]]'' (1984) and ''[[True Blue (Madonna album)|True Blue]]'' (1986), as well as the [[Grammy Award]] winners ''[[Ray of Light]]'' (1998) and ''[[Confessions on a Dance Floor]]'' (2005). Throughout her career, Madonna has written and produced most of [[List of songs recorded by Madonna|her songs]], with many of them reaching number one on the record charts, including \"[[Like a Virgin (song)|Like a Virgin]]\", \"[[La Isla Bonita]]\", \"[[Like a Prayer (song)|Like a Prayer]]\", \"[[Vogue (Madonna song)|Vogue]]\", \"[[Take a Bow (Madonna song)|Take a Bow]]\", \"[[Frozen (Madonna song)|Frozen]]\", \"[[Music (Madonna song)|Music]]\", \"[[Hung Up]]\", and \"[[4 Minutes]]\".\n\nMadonna's popularity was further enhanced by her roles in films such as ''[[Desperately Seeking Susan]]'' (1985), ''[[Dick Tracy (1990 film)|Dick Tracy]]'' (1990), ''[[A League of Their Own]]'' (1992), and ''[[Evita (1996 film)|Evita]]'' (1996). While the latter earned her a [[Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical|Best Actress]], many of her other films received poor reviews. As a  businesswoman, Madonna founded her own entertainment company [[Maverick (company)|Maverick]], including the label Maverick Records, in 1992. Her other ventures include [[Madonna fashion brands|fashion design]], writing [[Madonna bibliography|children's books]], opening of health clubs, and filmmaking. She contributed in various charities and founded Ray of Light Foundation in 1998 and [[Raising Malawi]] in 2006.\n\nHaving sold more than 300 million records worldwide&lt;!--Do NOT change without consensus on talk page--&gt;, Madonna is noted as the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling female recording artist of all time]] by ''[[Guinness World Records]]''. The [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) listed her as [[List of highest-certified music artists in the United States|the second highest-certified female artist in the U.S.]], with 64.5 million&amp;nbsp;[[RIAA certification|album units]]. According to ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', Madonna is the most successful solo artist in its [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] chart history. She is also the [[List of highest-grossing concert tours|highest-grossing solo touring artist of all time]], accumulating U.S. $1.4&amp;nbsp;billion from her concert tickets. Inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in her first year of eligibility, Madonna topped [[VH1]]'s countdown of [[The Greatest (TV series)|100 Greatest Women in Music]]. Additionally, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' listed her among the [[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time|100 Greatest Artists of All Time]] and the [[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time|100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time]].\n\n==Life and career==\n\n===1958\u20131981: Early life and career beginnings===\nMadonna was born to Catholic parents Madonna Louise (''n\u00e9e'' Fortin) and Silvio Anthony \"Tony\" Ciccone&lt;ref name=\"mom\"/&gt; in [[Bay City, Michigan]] on August 16, 1958.&lt;ref name=allmusicbio&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.allmusic.com/artist/madonna-mn0000237205/biography | title= Madonna Biography |first= Stephen Thomas|last=Erlewine | publisher= [[AllMusic]] | accessdate=April 13, 2015|authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father's parents were Italian emigrants from [[Pacentro]], while her mother was of French-Canadian descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taraborrelli|2002|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tony worked as an engineer designer for [[Chrysler]] and [[General Motors]]. Since Madonna had the same name as her mother, family members called her \"Little Nonni\".

Months before her mother died of [[breast cancer]] at age 30 on December 1, 1963, Madonna noticed changes in her behavior and personality, although she did not understand the reason.&lt;ref name=\"mom\"/&gt; Her mother was at a loss to explain her medical condition, and often began to cry when Madonna questioned her about it. Madonna later acknowledged that she had not grasped the concept of her mother dying.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morton|2002|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nMadonna turned to her paternal grandmother for solace. The Ciccone siblings resented housekeepers and rebelled against anyone brought into their home who they thought would try to take the place of their beloved mother. Madonna later told ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' that she saw herself in her youth as a \"lonely girl who was searching for something. I wasn't rebellious in a certain way. I cared about being good at something. I didn't shave my underarms and I didn't wear make-up like normal girls do. But I studied and I got good grades.... I wanted to be somebody.\" Terrified that her father Tony could be taken from her as well, Madonna was often unable to sleep unless she was near him.&lt;ref name=\"mom\"/&gt;\n\n[[File:Madonna family in their vineyard cropped.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Madonna's stepmother and father, Joan and Tony Ciccone (2009)]]\nIn 1966, Tony married the family's housekeeper Joan Gustafson.

Madonna was known for her high [[Grade (education)|grade point average]], and achieved notoriety for her unconventional behavior.
